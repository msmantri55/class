Accept a string with up to 3 levels of parentheses, ignoring the
characters between, before, or after the parentheses. Reject the
string if the parentheses are unbalanced, if there are no parentheses
in the string, or if the nesting is deeper than three. You should
accept compute((1+2)+((5+2*8+2))), and ((())) but reject ((((4)))),
(()())), and 4+3.
