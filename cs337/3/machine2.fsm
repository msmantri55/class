Accept only comma-separated integers (use integer as defined above
in item 1) An example of a comma-separated integer would be 2,000
or 6,500,000. But 3000 and 3,00,0 must be rejected. Notice that the
commas must be in the thousandth, millionth, billionth, etc.
positions. If the number is 999 or less it should be accepted.

/^0|[1-9][0-9]{,2}(,[0-9]{3})*$/
