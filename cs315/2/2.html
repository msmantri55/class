<H2>CS 315 Assignment 2: Recursion and Lists</H2>

<H3>Due: February 10, 2009.</H3>

<P>
This assignment may be done in Java or in Lisp.

<LI> Write a recursive function <TT>sumsq(int n)</TT> that adds up
the squares of the integers from <TT>1</TT> through <TT>n</TT>.

<LI> The mathematician Giuseppe Peano (1858 - 1932) showed that all
arithmetic operations on natural numbers (nonnegative integers) could be
reduced to a single constant (0) and an operation <I>successor</I>, which
is available in Java as <TT>++</TT> (in Lisp, <TT>1+</TT>).
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Peano was one of the first to use what we now call symbolic logic.
He introduced, for instance, the use of the symbols `(E x)' to mean
`there is an x such that'; and he habitually wrote out all of his
lecture notes in his new symbolism.  He was teaching at a military
academy at the time, and his students were so incensed by his
formalistic approach to mathematics that they rebelled (despite his
promises to pass them all) and got him fired.  Subsequently he found a
more congenial setting at the University of Turin.  -- Rudy Rucker,
<I> Goedel's Incompleteness Theorems</I>, p. 289.

<P>
Write a function <TT>peanoplus(int x, int y)</TT>, using only <TT>++</TT>
and <TT>--</TT>, to perform addition according to the following definition:
<TABLE>
<TR><TD>
peanoplus(x, y) = </TD><TD> x </TD><TD> ,  if    y = 0 </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
 </TD><TD> peanoplus(x + 1, y - 1) </TD><TD> ,  otherwise.
</TABLE>
Can you think of an <I> invariant</I> (property that is always true)
of <TT>peanoplus</TT>?  What is the Big O of <TT>peanoplus</TT>?
This function is naturally <I>tail-recursive</I>.
<P>
<LI> Write a function <TT> peanotimes(int x, int y)</TT> that uses only
<TT> peanoplus</TT>, <TT>++</TT>, and <TT>--</TT>,
and is written in a recursive style similar to that of <TT>peanoplus</TT>.
What is the Big O of <TT>peanotimes</TT>?
<P>
<LI> The mathematical notation <IMG SRC="cs307nka.gif" ALIGN=center>,
read <I>n choose k</I>,
is used to denote the number of distinct subsets of <I>k</I> items that can be
chosen from a set of <I>n</I> distinct objects.  It can be shown that:
<P>
<IMG SRC="cs307nkb.gif">
<P>
Although the <TT>factorial</TT> function could be used in implementing
<I>n</I> choose <I>k</I>, this would be inefficient for large values of
<I>n</I> and small <I>k</I>.  We have also seen that <TT>factorial</TT>
quickly overflows the available accuracy of the basic types in Java.
We can algebraically rewrite the definition into the following form for
<I>k &gt 0</I>:
<P>
<IMG SRC="cs307nkc.gif">
<P>
Write a function <TT>choose(int n, int k)</TT>, using a tail-recursive
auxiliary function, to compute <I>n</I> choose <I>k</I> without using the
<TT>factorial</TT> function.

<!--    Can you prove that the result of your auxiliary function
is always an integer?  This would be a good invariant for
your recursive function: although non-integer intermediate results will
work in Lisp, they would not work in most languages.  -->

<LI> Write a function <TT>sumlist(Cons lst)</TT> to add up a list of
<TT>Integer</TT>.  Write several versions of this function:
<TT>sumlist</TT> (iterative),
<TT>sumlistr</TT> (recursive), and <TT>sumlisttr</TT> (tail-recursive
using an auxiliary function).

<LI> Write a function <TT>sumsqdiff(Cons lsta, Cons lstb)</TT> to compute
the sum of squared item-by-item differences between two lists of
<TT>Integer</TT>.  Write several versions of this function: iterative,
recursive, and tail-recursive using an auxiliary function.

<LI> Write a function <TT>maxlist(Cons lst)</TT> to compute the maximum
in a list of <TT>Integer</TT>.  Write several versions of this function:
iterative, recursive, and tail-recursive using an auxiliary function.

<LI> Binomial coefficients are the numeric factors of the products
in a power of a binomial such as (<I>x + y</I>)<SUP><I>n</I></SUP>.
For example,
<I> (x + y)<SUP>2</SUP>   =   x<SUP>2</SUP> + 2 x y + y<SUP>2</SUP> </I>
has the coefficients <TT> 1 2 1</TT>.  Binomial coefficients can be
calculated using Pascal's triangle:
<PRE>
            1                   n = 0
         1     1
      1     2     1
   1     3     3     1
1     4     6     4     1       n = 4
</PRE>
<P>
Each new level of the triangle has <TT>1</TT>'s on the ends; the interior
numbers are the sums of the two numbers above them.  Write a program
<TT>binomial(int n)</TT> to produce a list of binomial coefficients for
the power <TT>n</TT> using the Pascal's triangle technique.  You may
write additional auxiliary functions as needed.
<TT>binomial</TT> should be a recursive program that manipulates lists;
it should not use use <TT>(choose n k)</TT>.
Use the function <TT>(choose n k)</TT> that you wrote earlier to
calculate <TT>(choose 4 k)</TT> for <TT>k</TT> from <TT>0</TT> through
<TT>4</TT>; what is the relationship between these values and the
binomial coefficients?
