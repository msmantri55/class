2.	An invariant of peanoplus is that peanoplus(x, 0) always equals 0.
	The Big O of peanoplus is O(n).

3.	The Big O of peanotimes is O(n^2).

8.	The binomial coefficients for the power n (that is, binomial(n)) are
	identical to the values of n choose k for k = 0, ..., n.
	ex:	binomial(4):	1 4 6 4 1
		choose(4, 0):	1
		choose(4, 1):	4
		choose(4, 2):	6
		choose(4, 3):	4
		choose(4, 4):	1
