<H2>CS 315 Assignment 9: Memos and Drums</H2>

<H3>Due: April 21, 2009.</H3>

<B>Files:</B> <tt>Cons.java</tt> &nbsp <tt>Event.java</tt> &nbsp
<tt>patmatch.lsp</tt> &nbsp <tt>patterns.lsp</tt> &nbsp <tt>patm.lsp</tt>

<P>
Some functions that you may need are provided in the file
<tt>Cons.java</tt>, and you will need some of your functions from the
last assignment.  Question 1 may be done in Java or in Lisp; the rest
should be done in Java.

<OL>

<P><LI> Write a recursive function <tt>Object solve(Object e, String v)</tt> that
attempts to solve the equation <tt>e</tt> for variable <tt>v</tt>,
which we assume occurs at most once in <tt>e</tt>.
<P>
This function will do the same thing as the earlier version of
<tt>solve</tt>; in this version, use patterns to rewrite the given
expression.  The three base cases are the same as before, and you
can copy your earlier code for those cases.
<OL>
<LI> If the left-hand side (lhs) of <tt>e</tt> is <tt>v</tt>, return <tt>e</tt>.
<PRE>
   (solve '(= f (* m a)) 'f)  =>  (= f (* m a))
</PRE>

<LI> If the right-hand side (rhs) of <tt>e</tt> is <tt>v</tt>, return <tt>e</tt>
with its arguments reversed.
<PRE>
   (solve '(= (* m a) f) 'f)  =  (= f (* m a))
</PRE>

<LI> If the rhs is not <tt>v</tt> and not a Cons, return <tt>null</tt>.

<P><LI> If the rhs of <tt>e</tt> is a Cons (i.e. an operation), try to
solve the equation by applying algebraic transformations from a list
of patterns, <tt>algpats</tt>.  For each pattern in the list, try
to <tt>transform</tt> the expression <tt>e</tt> using the pattern.
If the transformation works (is not <tt>null</tt>), call <tt>solve</tt>
recursively on the transformed version of <tt>e</tt>; if the result of
<tt>solve</tt> is not <tt>null</tt>,
return that result.  Otherwise, continue through the list of patterns.
If all patterns have been tried, return <tt>null</tt>.
</OL>
<P>
An initial list of patterns is provided; add patterns to complete the set.


<P><LI> Write a method <tt>hashCode()</tt> for the class <tt>Cons</tt>.
The <tt>hashCode</tt> of a Cons should be the XOR of the
<tt>hashCode</tt> of the <tt>first</tt> times <tt>17</tt> and the
<tt>hashCode</tt> of the <tt>rest</tt> times <tt>127</tt>.
The <tt>hashCode</tt> of <tt>null</tt> should be 0; use an
auxiliary function to make sure that you do not try to call
<tt>hashCode()</tt> on <tt>null</tt>, which would cause a runtime
exception.


<P><LI> Write a class <tt>Memoizer</tt> (in a file <tt>Memoizer.java</tt>)
that implements memoization of a function call.  Memoization is a
technique for wrapping an expensive function with a memory structure
that remembers previously computed values of the function.  If the
function is called again with the same argument value, it will be
cheaper to look up the saved value than to recompute it.
<P>
The class should be created using <tt>new Memoizer(Functor f)</tt>
where <tt>f</tt> is a functor that wraps the function associated
with the memoizer.
<P>
Use a <tt>HashMap</tt> within the <tt>Memoizer</tt> to associate
function values with argument values.  You can Google "java hashmap"
to get documentation of a <tt>HashMap</tt>.
<P>
<tt>Memoizer</tt> should have a method <tt>Object call(Object x)</tt>
to perform the wrapped function call.
The <tt>call</tt> method should operate as follows:
<OL>
<LI> First, <tt>call</tt> should look up the parameter <tt>x</tt>
in the <tt>HashMap</tt>; if it is present, return the value associated
with <tt>x</tt> (without calling the <tt>Functor</tt>).

<P><LI> Otherwise,
<OL><LI> Call the <tt>Functor</tt> to compute the value of <tt>fn(x)</tt>.
    <LI> Add the value <tt>fn(x)</tt> to the <tt>HashMap</tt> for the
     key <tt>x</tt>.
    <LI> Return the value <tt>fn(x)</tt>.
</OL>
</OL>

<P><LI> An Austin company is making a digital drum and percussion
synthesizer, and they have hired you to write the software.  Since
musicians are not always good programmers, the input language
that is used to specify a drum pattern needs to be simple.  The
software needs to convert the specified drum pattern into a time
sequence of I/O commands to drive the drum synthesizer units.
Since music is a language, we expect that a drum program will be
structured as a tree.
<P>
The drum synthesizer driver program is implemented as a
discrete-event simulator, based on a <tt>PriorityQueue</tt>.
You can Google "java priorityqueue"
to get documentation of a <tt>PriorityQueue</tt>.
<P>
A discrete-event simulator processes a sequence of <I>events</I>
which are scheduled at particular clock times.  The
<tt>PriorityQueue</tt> is used to hold the pending events, with the
priority being the time at which an event is scheduled to occur.
In operation, the simulator removes the highest-priority
(smallest time value) event from the queue, sets the current time
to the time of the event, and executes it;
the event will typically perform some action, and it may schedule
other events for the future.  The simulation stops if the queue
becomes empty.
<P>
We will assume that time values are integers.  Events that occur
at the same integer time are considered to be simultaneous,
regardless of their order, since the computer is much faster
than the drum units.
<P>
An <tt>Event</tt> has a scheduled <tt>.time()</tt> and an
<tt>.action()</tt>; this class is provided.  An action is a list,
consisting of a command followed by a parameter, which is usually
the length of time the command lasts.  Execution of a command returns
a String, which represents an I/O command to the drum unit; an
empty string represents a null command.  Write a function
<tt>String execute(PriorityQueue pq, Cons act, int time)</tt>
that executes an action and returns an appropriate String.
Commands are as follows, with <tt>d</tt> representing the duration
of the action:
<UL>
<LI> <tt>(delay d)</tt> returns ""
<LI> <tt>(moo d)</tt> returns "moo"
<LI> <tt>(cowbell d)</tt> returns "ding"
<LI> <tt>(cymbal d)</tt> returns "cym"
<LI> <tt>(boom d)</tt> returns "boom"
<LI> <tt>(chucka d)</tt> returns "chucka"
<LI> <tt>(boomchucka d)</tt> schedules <tt>(chucka d/2)</tt> at half of
its duration past the current time, and returns "boom".
<LI> <tt>(tambourine d)</tt> multiplies its duration by a random number,
obtained by calling <tt>random.nextDouble()</tt> ;
if the result is &gt 1, it schedules <tt>tambourine</tt> again with
that amount as its duration, at the current time plus current duration
minus that amount.  It returns "jingle".  (This random behavior simulates
a tambourine player who smokes way too much weed.)
<LI> <tt>(seq action<SUB>1</SUB> ... action<SUB>n</SUB>)</tt> schedules each of its actions
to execute in sequence, one after the other.  seq thus makes a sequence
of multiple actions look like a single action.  seq could either
schedule all of its actions at once, starting with the current time
and adding the time of each action, or it could schedule the first
action and schedule a seq for the rest of the actions.
<LI> <tt>(sync action<SUB>1</SUB> ... action<SUB>n</SUB>)</tt> schedules each of its actions
for the current time, then returns "".  <tt>sync</tt>
represents synchronized execution of multiple subprograms.
<LI> <tt>(repeat n action)</tt> schedules n events with the specified
action.  The first of these n events will happen at the same time
that repeat executes (i.e. simultaneously with repeat).  One way to
accomplish this is to schedule the action immediately;
then if n &gt 1, schedule <tt>(repeat n-1 action)</tt> for the current
time plus the time of the action.  Alternatively, repeat could simply
schedule all n events at once; this would use more queue space if n
is large.  <tt>repeat</tt> returns "".
</UL>
<P>
<PRE>
(seq (boom 4) (cowbell 2))

(seq (repeat 2 (boomchucka 4)) (repeat 3 (cymbal 2)))

(sync (repeat 2 (seq (repeat 2 (boomchucka 4)) (repeat 3 (cymbal 2))))
      (repeat 4 (cowbell 2))
      (repeat 5 (tambourine 5))
      (seq (delay 10) (moo 2)))
</PRE>

<P>
Write a function <tt>int totaltime(Cons action)</tt> that calculates
the total time required for an action.  For most actions, the time is
simply the duration of the action.  A <tt>repeat</tt> action has a time
that is the repeat count times the time of the sub-action.
A <tt>seq</tt> action takes the sum of the times of its sub-actions.
A <tt>sync</tt> action takes the maximum time of its sub-actions.
