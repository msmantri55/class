<H3>CS361 Assignment 3 </H3>

<P><B>Last modified:</B> Mon Sep 28 12:05:31 CDT 2009, changed due
date to Monday from Friday.

<P><B>Due:</B> Monday, October 5, by midnight<P>  

<B>Deliverables:</B> You will be submitting your code electronically
to the TA.  Submission instructions are on the class website. Make
sure that you clearly identify the members of your team (one or two
people).  Include a README file so that the TA will understand clearly
how to compile and run your code. 

<P><I>Make sure that all members of your team understand the code and
contribute equally, as much as possible, to its development.</I><P>

Information on how to submit your assignment is available at
<A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ctlight/cs361/how_to_submit.html">How
to submit</A><P>

For this assignment: <OL> <LI> The primary file name should be
<TT>Biba.java</TT>.  Students are welcome to organize their
assignments into multiple files and must submit those files as well.
However, the main method must be in <TT>Biba.java</TT> and the
TA should be able to compile your program with <TT>javac
*.java</TT>.<BR><BR>

<LI>Students should submit to the TA a comma-separated file called
<TT>names.txt</TT> as in Assignment 1.<BR><BR>

<LI>The program should be executed via the following command:
<PRE> 
java Biba mode inputfilename
</PRE>
Here mode can be either "biba" or "library" and should not be case
sensitive.  Instructions should be read from the input file named on the command
line. Filenames on the command line are case sensitive. 
</OL>

<H3>Background</H3>

A question that often arises in secure system design is whether a
particular collection of security mechanisms is sufficient to
implement a given policy.  For example, if you had a Bell and LaPadula
system, could you use it to enforce Biba integrity by a clever
assignment of labels? (The answer is yes; think about how you'd do
that.) This is essentially the problem that Lipner considered in his
system: given BLP and Biba rules that were designed for military
security, can we use that to enforce a policy designed for a
commercial environment?  <P>

In your career, you could be asked to implement a policy on top of
some existing security mechanisms.  This assignment gives you the
opportunity to practice doing this in a benign setting. <P>

This is a two part assignment.  In part I, you will be implementing a
basic Biba Strict Integrity system, where the hierarchical levels and
categories are arbitrary.  In part II, you'll build upon part I to
implement a secure lending library.  Build your system such that you
can run in either BIBA mode or LIBRARY mode according to a flag that
can be entered at the command level.<P>

<H3>Part I: Basic Biba</H3>

Emulate a Biba Strict Integrity system.  Your system should accept the
following commands from a file whose name is specified on the command
line.  No commands are case sensitive.

<PRE>
   LEVELS  L1 L2 ... Lk
   CATEGORIES C1 C2 ... Cj
   OBJECT obj_name obj_level
   SUBJECT subj_name subj_level
   ADD-CAT obj_name cat_name
   REMOVE-CAT obj_name cat_name
   READ subj_name obj_name
   WRITE subj_name obj_name val
</PRE>
(Here "..." just indicates an arbitrary list of items; it's not a
construct that you have to implement.) A level, such as subj_level or
obj_level in the examples above, is 
input as K + 1 separate fields, where the first is the 
hierarchical component and the others are the need-to-know categories,  
e.g., "(L1, {A, B, C})" should be entered as "L1 A B C" A level is
always the last thing on a line to make it easier to parse.<P>

The intended semantics of these commands is as follows: 

<IL>
<LI> LEVELS introduces a linearly ordered set of hierarchical labels,
ordered from low to high.  There should be only one of these
commands.  If there is more than one, ignore all but the first one.
Example: LEVELS LOW MED HIGH

<LI> CATEGORIES introduces an unordered set of need-to-know
categories.  Multiple CATEGORIES lines are allowed, and introduce additional
categories. If a category is introduced multiple times, that's OK. 
Example: CATEGORIES A B C

<LI> OBJECT introduces a new object into the system at the given
level.  The level should have both a hierarchical component and a set
(which may be empty) of need-to-know categories.  We don't enforce
strong tranquility (on objects) in this system.  Executing another OBJECT command
for the same obj_name just replaces the old level by the new level.
All components of level must have been previously introduced.
Example: OBJECT O1 LOW A B

<LI> SUBJECT introduces a new subject into the system at the given
level. Executing another SUBJECT command on the same subj_name is an
error. We do enforce strong tranquility for subjects.
All components of level must have been previously introduced.

<LI> READ indicates an attempt by the named subject to read the named
object.  The READ method can return a boolean indicating whether the
access is permitted or denied.  <I>There is no need to actually
implement the functionality of READ.  I.e., no value need be returned
to the subject.</I>

<LI> WRITE indicates an attempt by the named subject to write to the
named object.  The WRITE method can return a boolean indicating
whether the access is permitted or denied.  <I>There is no need to
actually store any values.  That is, you're not emulating the system
operation; only emulating the security checks.</I> The val argument
must be present, but can be ignored.

<LI> ADD-CAT and REMOVE-CAT change the level of the indicated object
to add/remove the indicated category from the list of need-to-know
categories associated with that object.  Note that these operations
are merely a convenience since we already have this functionality
using the OBJECT command.  The supplied category must have been
previously introduced in a CATEGORIES statement.

</IL>
<P>

As usual, commands, including names, are not case sensitive.  Enforce
reasonable rules.  In particular, a subject or object's level should
not refer to hierarchical levels or categories that have not been
previously introduced.  There is no problem with having the same name
used in multiple ways.  For example, you could have a subject named
FRED, an object named FRED, and a category FRED. <P>

The idea is that the LEVELS, CATEGORIES, SUBJECT, OBJECT, ADD-CAT, and
REMOVE-CAT commands build up the basic infrastructure for your secure
system.  Then the system should check whether READ and WRITE
operations are permitted using the Biba Strict Integity rules.  <P>

When run in BIBA mode, your system should be able to process an
arbitrary list of commands, reject any that are illegal, and process
all the legal ones.  Print a nice audit log of the execution of
successive commands.  In particular, for each READ or WRITE, print out
whether or not the operation is allowed.
<P>


<H3>Part II: Lending Library</H3>

Assume that someone has delivered to you the basic Biba integrity
system in Part I.  Your task is to use this existing security system
to construct a secure on-line lending library.<P>

The idea is as follows.  The library contains various read-only
documents (objects): D1, ..., Dm.  There is also a pool of potential
borrowers (subjects): B1, ..., Bn.  Each document has an associated
list of allowed borrowers, which is an arbitrary subset of the pool of
subjects.  For example, it might be that document D19 is only
accessible by B3, B7 and B12, while D82 might be accessible only by B7
and B15.  The idea of Part II is to implement a system that provides
this functionality.  Don't implement this from scratch, but use your
existing Biba integrity system (Part I) as your implementation platform. <P>

Your library system will have the following commands, read from
your input file. 
<PRE>
   READER reader_name
   DOCUMENT doc_name reader_namei reader_namej reader_namek
   CHECKOUT doc_name reader_name
   RETURN doc_name reader_name
   REVOKE doc_name reader_name
</PRE>
There can be any number of readers listed in the DOCUMENT command.<P>

These commands have the following interpretation:
<IL>

<LI> READER introduces a new potential borrower (subject) into the system. 

<LI> DOCUMENT introduces a new document (object) into the system and
authorizes the listed readers to have access to it.  Multiple DOCUMENT
commands for the same doc_name may augment the permission list with
additional readers.  They do not revoke any permissions.

<LI> CHECKOUT delivers the document to the requesting reader if
permitted (if the requesting reader is on the list of allowed readers
for the document).  Otherwise, it does nothing.  Your system should
keep a record of which documents are checked out to which readers.
Multiple readers can have a document checked out at the same time. 
No reader may check out a document he already holds.

<LI> RETURN removes the book from the reader's record of items checked
out.

<LI> REVOKE removes the reader's permission to check out that item in
the future.  However, it does not do anything to seize the item if it
is currently checked out by that subject. 
</IL>

Keep a record of which documents are checked out to which readers.
This is an electronic system so a given document can be checked out to
multiple readers at the same time.  <P>

My intention for the way to implement this is as follows.  Let's refer
to our two systems as "Biba" and "Library".  We'll implement the
Library system by "compiling" commands into programs for the
underlying Biba system.  Emulate each Library mode command, by running
series of commands at the Biba system level. You may have to run
several Biba commands to initialize the system. 
<P>

Each document/borrower at the Library level will be implemented as an
object/subject in the Biba level.  Each will have a label that will
permit exactly the accesses required.  Let's say that document
GoneWithTheWind can only be checked out by Fred and Ethel.  Then we
give the document the label (low, {fred, ethel}).  Fred has label
(low, {fred}) and Ethel has label (low, {ethel}).  Notice that the
object level dominates the subject level for Fred and for Ethel, but
for <I>no other possible subjects.</I> Following this scheme and the
Biba rules, only Fred and Ethel could ever successfully execute a READ
instruction on this document.<P>

To get the Library system started, initialize by executing the
following command on the underlying BIBA system: 
<PRE> LEVELS low </PRE> 
This is the only hierarchical level required.  The work is all done
with need-to-know categories.  <P>

Then, each command in the Library system is "compiled" into commands
for the underlying Biba system along with some additional
recordkeeping.  For example, the Library system command
<PRE>
   READER fred
</PRE>
is implemented by the Biba commands:
<PRE>
   CATEGORIES fred
   SUBJECT fred low fred
</PRE>
This creates a subject named Fred at the Biba level and gives it the
appropriate level (low, {fred}). 

<P>
The library system commands: 
<PRE>
   DOCUMENT MobyDick fred ethel ricky
   DOCUMENT MobyDick lucy
</PRE>
are implemented by the Biba commands:
<PRE>
   OBJECT MobyDick low fred ethel ricky
   ADD-CAT MobyDick lucy
</PRE>
This creates an object named MobyDick at the Biba level and gives it
the integrity label (low, {fred, ethel, ricky, lucy}). 

<P>
The library system command: 
<PRE>
   CHECKOUT MobyDick ethel
</PRE>
is implemented by invoking the Biba command
<PRE>
   READ ethel MobyDick
</PRE>
and recording that Ethel has this document checked-out (assuming that
the current permissions allow this READ). <P>

Your task is to devise implementations for the other commands and to
implement this system.  You will need to maintain a database of the subjects
and objects of the system.  For a subject, you'll store the name,
level, and documents checked out.  For an object you'll store the name
and level. Note that the labels of objects change over time.  The
levels of subjects should not change, once established.<P>

Design your Library system to be useful and fairly user-friendly.
Print out a reasonable commentary on what's happening with each
instruction executed.  Don't worry about covert channels. <P>

Construct your system such that it can be run in either BIBA mode or
LIBRARY mode.  In BIBA mode, it accepts only Biba commands; in LIBRARY
mode it accepts only Library commands.  In Library mode, the BIBA
interaction is hidden from the user by the Library command interface.
Note that no command in your LIBRARY implementation should ever invoke
the BIBA WRITE command.  That is the way that you enforce the
read-only nature of all the documents.
