<H2>CS361 Assignment 2 </H2>

<P><B>Last modified:</B> Thu Sep 10 15:00:22 CDT 2009

<P><B>Due:</B> Monday, September 21, 2009 by midnight.<P>  

Your assignment is to update your secure system from Assignment 1 and
add three new operations designed to introduce a covert channel into
the system.  You will implement the channel and use it to signal
information from a high level user to a low level user.  Finally, you
will measure and report the bandwidth of the channel.<P>

<H3>Deliverables:</H3>

You will be submitting your code electronically to the TA.  Make sure
that your code is well-annotated (commented) and follows good coding
style. Clearly identify the members of your team (one or two people).
Include a README file explaining how to run your program and the
timing information requested below.

<P><I>Make sure that all members of your group understand the code and
contribute equally, as much as possible, to its development. If anyone
gets a free ride, they'll be very disadvantaged later.</I>

Information on how to submit your assignment is available at
<A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ctlight/cs361/how_to_submit.html">How
to submit</A><P>

For this assignment: <OL> <LI> The primary file name should be
<TT>CovertChannel.java</TT>.  Students are welcome to organize their
assignments into multiple files and must submit those files as well.
However, the main method must be in <TT>CovertChannel.java</TT> and the
TA should be able to compile your program with <TT>javac
*.java</TT>.<BR><BR>

<LI>Students should submit to the TA a comma-separated file called
<TT>names.txt</TT> as in Assignment 1.<BR><BR>

<LI>The program should be executed via one of the following commands: 
<PRE> 
java CovertChannel v inputfilename 
java CovertChannel inputfilename 
</PRE>

Your output file should be named inputfilename.out.  That is, take the
supplied input filename and append ".out" to it.  If the call has the "v" (for
"verbose") option, you should also output to a file called "log" the
instructions that you generate.  (See below.)<BR><BR>

<LI>Submit a README file with your program, including any information
you'd like the TA to know.  Also, record the bandwidth information for
several runs of your program on different files, compute the average,
and include that information along with the machine type and clock
speed in the README file for your program.

</OL>


<H3>The Assignment</H3>

Update your secure system from Assignment 1 to add three new instructions: 
<PRE>
   CREATE  subject_name object_name 
   DESTROY subject_name object_name
   RUN     subject_name
</PRE>
Again, instructions are NOT case-sensitive.<P>

The intended semantics of CREATE is that a new object is added to the
state with SecurityLevel equal to the level of the creating subject.
It is given an initial value of 0.  If there already exists an object
with that name <I>at any level</I>, the operation is a no-op.<P>

DESTROY will eliminate the designated object from the state, assuming
that the object exists and the subject has WRITE access to the object
according to the *-property of BLP.  Otherwise, the operation is a
no-op.<P>

RUN allows the named subject to execute some arbitrary private code.
It has no access to any of the state objects, and so <I>should</I> be
irrelevant to the security of the system.  It models whatever
processing the subject may do with the value it has just read.  You
should code this as a method within your SecureSubject class.<P>

Note that calls to RUN will do different things, depending on the
value of the local state, particularly the executing subject.  That
is, RUN does very different things for Lyle than for Hal.
The code that RUN executes can do anything to the local state of the
running Subject but must not access any of the system objects.  That
is, you can have local variables and manipulate those as you like, but
cannot access any of the SecureObjects.  <P>

As with the previous assignment, you will define two subjects Hal and
Lyle, but no objects.  You will generate the instructions necessary to
pass information from Hal to Lyle using the covert channel we
described in class. (See below.)  However, generate the instructions
to be executed on the fly rather than reading them from an external
file.  (If you generated them, wrote them to a file, and then read
them back in your performance would suffer quite badly from the extra
IO.)  The execution of the instructions you generate should implement
a covert channel passing information one bit at a time from Hal to
Lyle.  You can assume that Hal and Lyle are the only two subjects and
have those names.  Also note that you can eliminate most parsing and
syntax checking since you'll be generating only correct instructions. <P>

If your program is running with the "v" parameter, you should log
the instructions that you generate one per line to a file called
"log".  This will allow the TA to ensure that you are actually using
the covert channel to transfer the information.  For your timing runs,
don't use the "v" parameter.<P>

Implement the following covert channel. (If you think you have a
better channel that you'd like to implement, please discuss it with me
first.)  For this channel, to send a 0 bit Hal executes:
<PRE>
  RUN HAL
  CREATE HAL OBJ
</PRE>

To send a 1 bit, Hal just does a RUN HAL.  (Note: You may not need for
HAL to do RUN.  It depends on how you structure your code.)  Lyle
senses the bit (the presence or absence of the object) by executing:

<PRE>
  CREATE LYLE OBJ
  WRITE LYLE OBJ 1
  READ LYLE OBJ
  DESTROY LYLE OBJ
  RUN LYLE
</PRE>

If Lyle sees a value of 1 returned from the READ, then his CREATE
succeeded, and Hal has not previously created the object (sending a 1
bit).  If Lyle sees a value of 0 returned from the READ, then Hal has
previously created the object, Lyle's CREATE has failed, and Hal has
sent a 0 bit.  (Notice that the value of 1 in the WRITE could have
been any non-zero value.)<P>

The goal is to send an arbitrary stream of bits (actually a complete
ASCII file) over this channel.  I advise getting your program running
by sending some small fixed number of bits and making sure they arrive
correctly.  However, the version you will submit will take a filename
parameter on the command line.  Your program will read the file
contents (probably one byte at a time using a ByteArrayInputStream),
convert each byte to 8 bits, send them through the covert channel,
reconstruct the byte on the receiving side and write it out to a file.
The idea is to transfer the contents of an arbitrary ASCII file over
the channel. <P>

As an alternative to using a ByteArrayInputStream, you can read a line
in the file into a String and access the bits from there. <I>Don't
read the entire file into a String.</I> That's not scalable.<P>

Your program may work for non-ASCII file types, but doesn't have to.
In a realistic system where the subjects were running as concurrent
threads, that would be very useful because Lyle would have to know
when he can stop receiving.  If you only worry about ASCII files, you
can assume that only ASCII characters appear in the file.  That means
you can use a non-ASCII character to signal the end of the
input. E.g., if Lyle receives a null byte 00000000, then he knows he
can stop receiving.  But for this version, your main program probably
knows when Hal is out of bits to send and just stops generating
instructions for Lyle.  That is, you probably don't have to worry
about sending an end byte from Hal to Lyle. <I>I think that's true, but
I'm not absolutely certain!</I>  <P>

Ideally, reading bytes from the file, breaking them into bits,
etc. should be done by the subjects themselves using their RUN
operation.  But you can use your main function to handle that kind of
thing if you need to.  That is, you can treat the entire program as a
big covert channel engine as long as you implement the covert channel
according to the directions above and don't cheat.<P>

The output file should be essentially identical to the input
file. Make sure to check that you preserve the first and last
characters in the file. I suggest using the Linux diff utility to
compare the files.<P>

Note that line endings are represented differently in different
systems.  Early teletype printers used the CR and LF control
characters, respectively, to move the print head left and then scroll
down one line.  But line termination is treated differently by
different modern operating system: Macintosh uses a CR (ASCII 13);
Linux uses a LF (ASCII 10); Windows uses both.  Most FTP programs
substitute appropriate line endings if transferring in ``text mode.''
If in ``binary mode'' no translations occur.  This shouldn't matter to
you unless you transferred your input file onto a different system in
binary mode.  In that case, your program might not recognize the end
of lines correctly.  <P>

Finally, time your program execution on several different input files
and compute the channel's average bandwidth in bits / second.  Your
program should compute and write to standard output the timing and
bandwidth for a given run.  Record that information for several runs,
compute the average, and include that information along with the
machine type and clock speed in the README file for your program.  You
won't be graded on the bandwidth, but we'll collect the results and
see which group's program was the most efficient.

<H2>Extra Credit </H2>

If anyone is interested in getting extra credit by recoding this such
that Lyle and Hal run in separate threads, contact me individually.
It's pretty challenging.

<!-- 

These are the guidelines that Vacha set up for grading this one:

Assignment 2 grades are up on blackboard. As usual, the marking is
from 10 points. Following are the reasons for which points have been
deducted with respective deductions:

1. If the program fails to print statistics enough to calculate
throughput (-0.5) This means that only timing info(bytes can be
obtained from output file size), or throughput, timing info + bits
transferred is ok and did not cost points.

2. If the input and output file differ slightly (1-2 bytes) -0.5
points (Mostly first or last chars were missing). If more bytes than
this are missing, -1 point.

3.If no output file is created, but the output is printed on terminal
and can be verified as correct, -1 points. If no output file is
created and no information is available to ensure correct transfer -3
points.

4. If the output file was not written to properly (i.e writing 1's and
0's (as bytes) instead of bits - (-2) points

5. Finally if program did not run, caused exceptions, hung,p rinted
nothing useful etc, -4 points flat (i.e. points for not printing the
throughput and other mistakes were not cut in this case)

I would like to remind everyone to please state clearly, the
instructions for executing their code. This would mean a statement
like

java exampleprog
and the meaning of each of the arguments included.

Also, make sure that when code is submitted, it is execute
ready. Remove any packages that you might have in your code.

Thanks!
Vacha
