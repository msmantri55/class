<H4>Deliverables:</H4> 

You will be submitting your code electronically to the TA.  Make sure
that your code is commented and follows good coding
style. Clearly identify the members of your team (one or two people).
Along with your code, submit a README file explaining your algorithm
and listing which passwords you were and were not able to crack from
the two sample <b>/etc/passwd</b> files.  Include timing results showing
how long it took to crack the passwords.  You can invent your own
format for this information.

<P><I>Make sure that all members of your group understand the code and
contribute equally, as much as possible, to its development.</I>

Specifically: 
<OL>
<LI> The primary file name for assignment 4 is <TT>PasswordCrack.java</TT>. The

<H4>Password Cracking: Dictionary Attacks</H4>

On a traditional Unix system, passwords are stored in encrypted form
in a world-readable file <B>/etc/passwd</B>.  Moreover the encryption
algorithm is widely known.  This means that an attacker can attempt to
discover one or more passwords on the system by encrypting a sequence
of strings and comparing the results against the stored encrypted
passwords of the system.  If any of the trial encyrptions match stored
encrypted passwords, the attacker will know the corresponding
cleartext password for that user and can then use it to access the
user's account. This is a classic <I>dictionary attack</I> and
explains why many systems enforce rules to ensure that user-generated
passwords are not easily guessed words.<P>

Systematic password guessing involves both cleverness and brute force.
Dictionary attacks are so named because a word list, or dictionary, is
used to generate password guesses.  For example, the public Linux
systems at UT have such a dictionary file at <b>/usr/share/dict/words</b>.
A more sophisticated dictionary attack, not only uses common words and
phrases, but also attempts users' surnames, common pet names, etc.
Such words and phrases may be prepended to the dictionary and then
become available in the attack.<P>

A user may attempt to render his or her password unguessable by
"mangling" the plaintext password in some algorithmic way.  Some
common "mangles" (ways to take a password and make it less easily
guessable) are listed below.  Assume the plaintext password is
"string".  You might:

<UL>
<LI> prepend a character to the string, e.g., @string;
<LI> append a character to the string, e.g., string9;
<LI> delete the first character from the string, e.g., tring;
<LI> delete the last character from the string, e.g., strin; 
<LI> reverse the string, e.g., gnirts;
<LI> duplicate the string, e.g., stringstring;
<LI> reflect the string, e.g., stringgnirts or gnirtsstring;
<LI> uppercase the string, e.g., STRING;
<LI> lowercase the string, e.g., string;
<LI> capitalize the string, e.g., String;
<LI> ncapitalize the string, e.g., sTRING;
<LI> toggle case of the string, e.g., StRiNg or sTrInG;
</UL>

You need only consider characters that you could type from your
keyboard.  Weird control characters don't usually occur in passwords.

<P>
A program called Crack is available to system administrators to test
the guessability of user passwords, as well as by hackers to perform
dictionary attacks. You can view the documentation for Crack at <A
HREF="ftp://coast.cs.purdue.edu/pub/tools/unix/pwdutils/crack/">Crack
Documentation</A>.<P>

The goal of this assignment is to implement a portion of Crack's
functionality and attempt to guess one or more passwords.  Input to
your program will be a "captured" <b>/etc/passwd</b> file from a
system with 20 users.  Your aim is to crack as many passwords as
possible. <i>But don't expect to crack them all</i>;  there are a few
passwords included generated from random strings.  If you get 15 or so
passwords, you're doing just fine.<P>

How do you know when to stop?  You don't!  Write the program to run
until it finds all of the passwords.  The TA will stop it when he gets
tired of waiting.  Realistically, your program should find a majority
of the passwords (12 or so) in just a few minutes.  Make sure that you
print out the passwords as they are found and that you code your
program reasonably efficiently. <P>

To do this for a specific user, you might take the following steps:
<OL>
<LI> Extract the encrypted password and salt for that user (see format
below);
<LI> Seed the word list with words that the user might have
utilized in constructing his or her password (e.g., his first and last
name); 
<LI> With the salt and augmented wordlist, systematically
encrypt words and compare against the stored encrypted password; 
<LI> Redo step 3, but using mangled versions of the words; 
<LI> Redo step 4, attempting to apply two mangles to each word.
</OL>

Design your program in such a way as to be as efficient as possible.
For example, your program should stop searching with respect to a
given user if you have cracked that password.  Consider whether to use
a breadth-first or depth-first search.  The algorithm only considers
the first 8 characters of a password, but the user might or might not
take that into account.  You do not have to break all passwords, but
you should break at least the simple passwords (generated from words
in the dictionary using one mangle).<P>

For testing purposes, you will be provided with the following files:
<UL>
<LI> <A HREF="passwd1">passwd1</A> - twenty accounts with plain
text passwords provided <A HREF="passwd1-answers">passwd1 answers</A><br>
<LI> <A HREF="passwd2">passwd2</A> - twenty accounts without plain text passwords
provided<br>
<LI> <A HREF="newshort-words">words</A> - a list of words that you can use as a dictionary
(alternatively, you could use the Unix system dictionary at
<b>/usr/share/dict/words</b> of ~100,000 words,
but expect things to run pretty slowly).
</UL>

After you turn in your program, it will be run against a third
<b>/etc/passwd</b> file, which will not be provided before the turn-in
date. This is to keep everyone honest, since it is completely possible
to just run Crack on the provided files.<P>

<H4>Encryption Specifics</H4>

On traditional UNIX system, passwords are encrypted and stored in the
file <b>/etc/passwd</b>.  The stored value is actually the result of
encrypting a string of zeros with a key formed from the first eight
characters of your password and a two-character "salt".<P>

The "salt" is a two-character string stored with a user's login
information.  Salt is used so that anyone guessing passwords has
to guess on a per-user basis rather than a per-system basis. 
Also, in the case that two users have the same password, as long as
they have different salt, their encrypted passwords will not be the
same.<P>

All of the passwords for this project have been encrypted using JCrypt
which can be found on-line at: <a
href="http://www.vulcanware.com/java_jcrypt/jcrypt.java">JCrypt</a>.
JCrypt is a Java implementation of the UNIX Crypt function.  JCrypt
includes a method <b>crypt( String salt, String password )</b> which
will return the encrypted result of a given salt and password.  Be
careful--some implementations seem to take the args in the opposite
order: <b>crypt( String password, String salt )</b>.<P>

For example, if a user's plain text password is "amazing" and the salt
is "(b", then JCrypt would return "(bUx9LiAcW8As".  
Use JCrypt in your program when checking your password guesses.<P>

Lines in /etc/passwd have the following format, with fields separated by colons:<br>
<div, align="center">
account:encrypted password data:uid:gid:GCOS-field:homedir:shell
</div> <P>

For example, this line represents the account for Tyler Jones. 
The salt is "&lt;q".<br>

<div, align="center">
tyler:&lt;qt0.GlIrXuKs:503:503:Tyler Jones:/home/tyler:/bin/tcsh
</div><P>

The encrypted password data field is thirteen characters long. 
The first two characters are the salt, and the next eleven characters
are the encrypted password (actually, a string of zeros encrypted with
the salt and the password).<P>

Newer systems make dictionary attacks more difficult by employing
"shadow passwords."  In a shadow password system, the password field
in /etc/passwd is replaced with an 'x'.  Actual encrypted passwords
are stored in a file /etc/shadow which is not world-readable.<P>

Notes<br>
</big></big>When cracking my sample passwd file on a relatively fast
machine:<br>
<br>
Using a 45,000 word dictionary<br>
"very easy" passwords were cracked in seconds each.<br>
"one mangle" passwords were cracked in one to five minutes each.<br>
"two mangle" passwords were cracked in six to twelve hours each.<br>
my program does not attempt to crack dustin's or paige's account.<br>
<br>
Using a dictionary only containing the words from which the passwords
were derived<br>
</small></small></big></big><big><big><small><small>"very easy"
passwords were cracked in almost zero time.<br>
"one mangle" passwords were cracked in seconds each.<br>
"two mangle" passwords were cracked one to two minutes.</small></small></big></big><big><big><small><small><br>
<br>
Since the time needed to crack two mangle passwords is very long, I
suggest only putting one (if any) in the assignment.  As an
alternative, you can provide a dictionary which is, say, one-eighth or
one-sixteenth the size of /usr/share/dict/words.  Then, guarantee
the students that most passwords were derived from words in that
dictionary.  Any linear decrease in dictionary size would linearly
decrease runtime.<br>
<br>
There are also some ways that this program runs that are common-sense
time savers.  First, if it correctly guesses a password, it
stops.  Second, the search is breadth-first.  For each
account, I try all one mangle passwords, and then, the two
mangle passwords.  A depth-first search would take much longer to
find the easy passwords.<br>
<br>
Some of the users in my test have very bad passwords, but it takes a
degree of cleverness to try and guess them.  One user uses her
last name.  This is not in the dictionary.  Another user
users the reverse of his username.  At the very beginning of an
attempt to crack an account, I take simple fields like these and
prepend them to the dictionary.<br>
