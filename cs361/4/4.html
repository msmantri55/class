<P><B>Last modified:</B> Wed Oct 21 10:26:25 CDT 2009

<P><B>Due:</B> Monday, November 2, 2009 by midnight<P>

<B>Deliverables:</B> You will be submitting your code electronically
to the TA.  Make
sure that you clearly identify the members of your team (one or two
people).  Information on how to submit your assignment is available at
<A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ctlight/cs361/how_to_submit.html">How
to submit</A>

Your assignment is to implement AES-256, meaning the AES algorithm
with 256-bit keys.<P>

<P><I>Make sure that all members of your team understand the code and
contribute equally, as much as possible, to its development.</I><P>

Below are the specific instructions for this assignment.<P>

<OL>
<LI> Please provide a README file including your program timing
information and any other information you'd like us to know.  
<BR><BR>

<LI>The primary file name for assignment 5 is <tt>AES.java</tt>. The
main method must exist in <TT>AES.java</tt>. Students can add more
files as they wish but all files must be submitted.<BR><BR>

<LI>The assignment must be compiled by <TT>javac *.java</TT>.<BR><BR>

<LI>The assignment must be executed by the following command: <PRE>
java AES option keyFile inputFile </PRE> where <TT>keyFile</tt> is a
key file and <tt>inputFile</tt> is a plaintext and option is "e" or
"d" for encryption and decryption, respectively.  <tt>keyFile</tt>
contains a single line of 64 hex characters, which represents a
256-bit key.  The <tt>inputFile</tt> should have 32 hex characters per
line.  (However, see the procedures below for malformed or short
lines.)<BR><BR>

<LI>If option "e" is given, <tt>inputFile</tt> is encrypted with the
key from <tt>keyFile</tt> and the program outputs an encrypted file
named by adding extension ".enc" to the <tt>inputFile</tt>.  If option
"d" is given, <tt>inputFile</tt> is decrypted with a key from <tt>keyFile</tt>
and the program outputs an encrypted file named by adding an extension
".dec" to the <tt>inputFile</tt>. Please be sure that your encrypted
file matches  with the other AES program following the same requirements
and your decrypted file must match your original plain text (modulo
dealing with any malformed or short lines). 
<P>

As an example, if you run:
<pre>
java AES e key plaintext
</pre>
The output should  be in file  <tt>plaintext.enc</tt>.<P>

If you then run:
<pre>
java AES d key plaintext.enc
</pre>
The output would be in <tt>plaintext.enc.dec</tt>, and should match
the original <tt>plaintext</tt> input file. 
Also, <tt>plaintext.enc</tt> must
follow AES standards specified in the assignment page.<BR><BR>

<LI>Students also should submit to the TA a comma-separated file called
<tt>names.txt</tt> as in previous assignments.
</OL

<H3>Background</H3>

<I>One of my former students described this exercise as the "most
useful programming assignment" he had in his undergraduate career, and
one that he mentions on his resume and in interviews with prospective
employers.  I hope that you find it useful as well.</I><P>

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a very important commercial
block cipher algorithm, designed to replace the earlier DES.<P>

AES uses repeat cycles or ``rounds.''  There are 10, 12, or 14 rounds
for keys of 128, 192, and 256 bits, respectively.  The input text is
represented as a 4 x 4 array of bytes.  The key is represented as a 4
x n array of bytes, where n depends on the key size. <P>

Each round of the algorithm consists of four steps:
<OL>
<LI><B>subBytes:</B> for each byte in the array, use
its value as an index into a fixed 256-element lookup table, and replace its
value in the state by the byte value stored at that location in the
table.  You can find the table and the inverse table on the web.

<LI><B>shiftRows:</B> Let Ri denote the ith row in state.  Shift R0 in
the state left 0 bytes (i.e., no change); shift R1 left 1 byte; shift
R2 left 2 bytes; shift R3 left 3 bytes.  These are circular shifts.
They do not affect the individual byte values themselves.

<LI><B>mixColumns:</B> for each column of the state, replace the
column by its value multiplied by a fixed 4 x 4 matrix of integers (in
a particular Galois Field).  This is the most complex step.  Find
details at any of several websites.  Note that the inverse operation
multiplies by a different matrix. 

<LI><B>addRoundkey:</B> XOR the state with a 
128-bit round key derived from the original key K by a recursive process.
</OL>
For encryption, the final round is slightly different from the others
and there is an additional addRoundKey.  For decryption, the initial
round is slightly different and there is an additional addRoundKey.
<P>

<H3>The Assignment</H3>

Your assignment is to implement AES-256.  That means that you will use
128-bit input, 256-bit key, 14 rounds.  While you are debugging, I'd
suggest that you hard code the key and input block.  After that, you
should input them from a file as specified above.<P>

There is a tremendous amount of information on the web about the AES
algorithm.  You can find it by searching for "Rijndael" or "Advanced
Encryption Standard" on the web.  The AES standard is here: <A
HREF="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips197/fips-197.pdf">
AES standard</A>.  Any questions about the algorithm can be resolved
by looking there.  There is also a book, <U>The Design of Rijndael</U>
by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen that describes the algorithm in
detail.  One student found the following website particularly helpful
in understanding AES.</B> <A
HREF="http://www.cs.bc.edu/~straubin/cs381-05/blockciphers/rijndael_ingles2004.swf">AES</A>
<b>But be aware that the animation is for AES-128, not for AES-256.</b>
<P>

In past semesters, a significant number of folks have had problems
with the key expansion algorithm.  Note that that the algorithm is
different depending on the key size.  Apparently the Wikipedia page on
AES has a pretty good description of the key generation.  (However,
one semester as a prank one of the students in the class changed one
value in the S-box on Wikipedia and caused some grief to other
students.)
<P>

Use Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode.  That is, encode each block
separately, without chaining blocks together. <P>

There are implementations of AES on the web and a reference
implementation in the back of the Daemen/Rijmen book. <I>Don't use
them. You are expected to code your own implementation.  Also, do not
consider using a friend's implementation from a previous semester.
The TA has all of those and will check that you have not used an old
submission.  It's far better for your grade if you skip this assignment
rather than to be caught cheating.</i><P>

After you have completed your coding of the algorithm, turn off all
unnecessary IO, and encrypt a large file.  That file should be a
series of lines, each containing a single 128-bit number in hex
format.  That is, you do not have to worry about encrypting an ASCII
file or other file type.  I'm less concerned that you can do that,
than that you have the algorithm correct.<P>

Just to be clear, your input file might start with the following
lines:
<PRE>
0A935D11496532BC1004865ABDCA4295
00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF
   ....
</PRE>
You'll read in a line, converting from Hex to binary for storage into
your state array.  Apply the AES algorithm to encrypt the string as
stored, and write out the ciphertext in Hex notation to the output
file.  When decrypting you'll reverse the process.  If any line
contains non-Hex characters, skip it.  If any line is less than 32 Hex
characters (128-bits) pad on the right with zeros.<P>

The key is stored in a separate file, but in the same format. For
example, for the 256-bit case, your key file might have the following
single line:
<PRE>
FFEEDDCCBBAA00998877665544332211FFEEDDCCBBAA00998877665544332211
</pre>
<P>

Your program should be able to do each of the following, in accordance
with the option command line argument:
<OL>
<LI>read in the file of Hex lines and output the corresponding
ciphertext in Hex;
<LI>read in an encrypted file and output the corresponding plaintext.
</OL>

Take measurements of the throughput.  That is, how many MB/sec can you
encrypt using your implementation?  Then decrypt the file and measure
the throughput.  Compare encryption and decryption speeds. <P>

<!-- <H3>Extra Credit</H3>

What's above is all that you must do to complete the assignment.
However, there are two extra steps you can complete for up to two
extra points (1 for each part).  In your README file, describe what
you did to improve your program in either of the following two
ways. <P>

<OL>
<LI>Modify your program so that it can run as either AES-128 or
AES-256. Your program should take an additional flag as input to say
which mode to run in.  <P>

<LI>Instrument your program to run in either of CBC or ECB mode. <P>
</OL>

Below are the specific instructions for the extra credit component of
this assignment:

<UL>
<LI> Provide a README file including the string "Extra Credit". <BR><BR>

<LI>Your extra credit assignment should be executed as follows.
<PRE>
java AES option [length] [mode] keyFile inputFile
</PRE>
where option is "e" or "d"; length is "-length 128" for 128 bits or
"-length 256" for 256 bits; mode is "-mode ecb" for ecb mod or "-mode
cbc" for cbc mode; <tt>keyFile</tt> is a key file containing a key of
the appropriate length; and <tt>inputFile</tt> is an input file to
encrypt or decrypt depending on <tt>option</tt>. <BR><BR>

<LI>The default length and mode are 128 and ecb if they are not
given. 
</UL> -->

<!-- <H3>Test Output for AES-128</H3>

Below is some test output from my program.  All of this data is in
hexadecimal notation.  It uses plaintext and key consisting of all
0's.  Also shown is the result of each step of the transformation.
You don't have to produce output that looks like this; it's here to
allow you to see the various transformations so that you can check
whether your program is behaving as it should.
