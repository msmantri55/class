<H2>CS361 Assignment 1 </H2>

<P><B>Last updated:</B> Thu Sep  3 10:11:31 CDT 2009

<P><B>Due:</B> Friday, September 11 by the end of the day.  This means that
your submission must be dated on or before that date.<P>

Each assignment is graded on a 10 point scale.  Note that it is
possible to get up to 2 extra credit points on this assignment.  That
info is at the bottom.<P>

<B>Deliverables:</B> You will be submitting your code electronically
to the TA.  Make sure that you clearly identify the members of your
team (one or two people).  Your program must be able to run on the UT
Linux machines, so if you develop on Windows, make sure it runs on Linux.<P>

Information on how to submit your assignment is available at
<A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ctlight/cs361/how_to_submit.html">How
to submit</A><P>

For this assignment: <OL> <LI> The primary file name should be
<TT>SecureSystem.java</TT>.  Students are welcome to organize their
assignments into multiple files and must submit those files as well.
However, the main method must be in <TT>SecureSystem.java</TT> and the
TA should be able to compile your program with <TT>javac
*.java</TT>.<BR><BR>

<LI>The program should be executed via the command:
<TT>java SecureSystem instructionList</TT><BR><BR>

<LI>Students should also submit to the TA a comma-separated file called
<TT>names.txt</TT> with file format is as follows:
<PRE>
UTCS ID, email, Name(First Name followed by Last Name), UTEID
</PRE>
For example, 
<PRE>
butch, butch@somemail.site , Butch Cassidy, butch0303
sundance, sundance@othermail.site, Sundance Kid, sundance0707
</PRE>
See also the more detailed submission instructions from the link
above.
</OL>

<P><I>Make sure that all members of your team understand the code and
contribute equally, as much as possible, to its development. If anyone
gets a free ride, they'll be disadvantaged later.</I>

<H3>The Assignment</H3>

<P> Your assignment is to implement in Java a simple "secure" system
following the Bell and LaPadula (BLP) security rules--simple security,
the *-property, and strong tranquility (meaning that no levels change
over the course of the assignment).  Take care with this assignment,
because it will form the basis of at least one subsequent assignment.

<P>I broke the assignment into two parts for your convenience, but it's
really one big assignment.  You don't have to separate or identify the
parts in your deliverables, but you may want to do Part 1 first, and then
incrementally add the functionality of Part 2.

<H3>Part 1 (of 2):</H3>

<P>
The input for your secure system will be a file of <I>commands</I>. 
For the current assignment, legal commands are of the form:

<PRE>
   READ subject_name object_name 
   WRITE subject_name object_name value 
</PRE>

<P>
All fields of the instruction are Strings except the value, 
which is an integer. 

<P>
Write a utility that reads successive lines from the file and parses
each line into an Instruction class object, then prints from the
Instruction object to standard output.  (I.e., don't just print the
input line.) <I>Commands are not case-sensitive, even object and
subject names.</I> Also, arbitrary whitespace is allowed in commands.

<P>
Here is a possible schema for the Instruction class.

<PRE>
class Instruction {

    // private fields to contain the fields of the instruction

    // constructors for Instruction objects

    // Accessors  / setters for the instruction fields

    public void printInstruction () {
        // utility to print the instruction to the output stream
	...
    } 

} // class Instruction
</PRE>

<P>
Be sure to deal with the possibility of errors in the instructions.
In particular, how do you deal with instructions that do not match
either of the legal formats?  Be sure to reject instructions that
don't have the appropriate number of fields.  I'd suggest that you
generate a BadInstruction object for those cases.  There is (possible)
sample output below.

<P>Your primary class should be called SecureSystem.  Below is a
possible template (for Part 1).  In Part 2, you'll add additional
methods. 

<PRE>
public class SecureSystem {

    public Instruction parseInstruction (String line) {
        // passed a line of text, parse it into an Instruction
	// object and return that object.  Deal with instructions
	// that are ill-formed. 
	...
    } 
    
    public static void main (String args[]) throws IOException {
        // Read lines from the input file, parse them as instructions
	// and print the instruction.
	// Be sure to deal with exceptional situations appropriately.
	...	
    }

} // class SecureSystem
</PRE>

Input is a file <TT>instructionList</TT> containing instructions.  For
example: 

<PRE>
write Hal HObj 
read Hal 
write Lyle LObj 10
read Hal LObj 
write Lyle HObj 20
write Hal LObj 200
read Hal HObj
read Lyle LObj
read Lyle HObj
foo Lyle LObj
Hi Lyle,This is Hal
The missile launch code is 1234567
</PRE>

Below is the output of a sample execution of my Part 1 solution.  Yours
doesn't have to match this exactly, but should convey roughly the same
information.  On a Linux system I executed the following command and
obtained the indicated output:

<PRE>
> java SecureSystem instructionList 

Reading from file: instructionList

Bad Instruction
Bad Instruction
lyle writes value 10 to lobj
hal reads lobj
lyle writes value 20 to hobj
hal writes value 200 to lobj
hal reads hobj
lyle reads lobj
lyle reads hobj
Bad Instruction
Bad Instruction
Bad Instruction
</PRE>

<P>Notice that you're not checking security attributes or definedness
of the subjects/objects in Part 1, merely the syntactic
well-formedness of the commands.

<H3>Part 2 (of 2):</H3>

<P>

Your system state is populated by SecureSubjects and SecureObjects.
These are each represented by a class.  Each SecureSubject has an
associated name, security level, and a "most recent value read"
variable that can hold a single int.  (The security level should not
be stored in the SecureSubject itself, but maintained by the Reference
Monitor; see below.)  Whether you store the subject's name in the
subject itself or just as a key into a mapping is up to you.

<P>
Each SecureObject instance has a name, security level, and int current
value.  SecureObject's should be managed by the ObjectManager (see
below), which in turn in managed by the Reference Monitor.  

<P>
You should have a SecurityLevel class that models security levels with
a defined "dominates" relation.  For the current system your levels
can be hierarchically (linearly) ordered.  That is, you don't have to
worry about need-to-know categories.  That means that you can just
have a local int constant that stores the level and define "dominates"
as "less than or equal" on the stored int value. Define two
SecurityLevel constants (final values) that represent the levels HIGH
and LOW.  For the current assignment, this is enough.

<P> Your system state should contain structures for accessing the
existing subjects and objects.  For example, defining<BR>
<PRE>
    Map secureSubjects = new HashMap();
</PRE>
would allow you to store subjects and access them by name.  The map
for subjects should probably be in the SecureSystem class.  The map
for objects likely will be in the ObjectManager class, which is inside
the ReferenceMonitor.  There may also be mappings from subject/object
names to SecurityLevels; these mappings are managed by the
ReferenceMonitor.<P> 
 
<P> SecureObjects in the system store a single integer value
(initially 0).  The ObjectManager maintains the objects and has
methods to create a new object and set and retrieve an object's value.
Think of the ObjectManager as a simple unsecure file system.  The
ObjectManager need not maintain security attributes for the objects.
That is done by the ReferenceMonitor, which mediates all accesses to
the ObjectManager.

<P> The ReferenceMonitor maintains the security information for the
system and acts as a security guard or firewall for the ObjectManager.
It maintains the mappings from subject/object names to SecurityLevel.
Whenever it receives an instruction from a subject, it must see if the
instruction is allowed according to the BLP rules.  If so, invoke the
ObjectManager to perform the appropriate operation.  If not, do nothing
except return a 0 value (see below).  Legal instructions and their
semantics are defined below.

<P> For this first assignment there are the two instructions defined
above.  An Instruction object is what the subject passes to the
ReferenceMonitor for execution.  

<P> If allowed, a READ operation returns the current value of the
named object to the subject.  A WRITE operation stores the indicated
value into the named object.  I'd suggest that ReferenceMonitor have
an executeInstruction method that returns an int value.  The value
returned is always 0 except in the case of a successful, legal READ
where the object's current value is returned.  (Of course, that could
also be a 0.)

<P>Write a debugging method printState in the SecureSystem class that
prints out the values of the objects and the most recent value read by
each subject.  See the example below for what the output of this could
look like.  Ideally, you should be able to iterate over your data
structures to handle an arbitrary number of subjects/objects, but for
this assignment you can assume that you know the names of the two
subjects/objects.  (Note: printing this kind of information is not
something that a typical system user should be able to do.)

<P>The main function in your SecureSystem class should perform the
following tasks: 
<OL>
<LI>Create two new subjects: Lyle of security level LOW, and Hal of
security level HIGH.  Initially the "value read" variable should
contain 0.  Store these subjects into the state and inform the
reference monitor about them.<BR><BR>

<LI>Create two new objects: LObj of security level LOW, and HObj of
security level HIGH.  Store these into the state and inform the
reference monitor about them.  The initial value of each should be
0. <BR><BR>

<LI>Read successive instructions from the input file and execute them,
following the Bell and LaPadula constraints on reading and writing.
You should have methods executeRead and executeWrite within your
SecureSystem class that check access requests and perform the
appropriate update (if any) on the state.  A READ instruction, if
permitted, should deliver the value of the object to the "value read"
field of the subject.  A WRITE instruction, if permitted, should
replace the value field of the object with the value in the
instruction. <BR><BR>

<LI>After each instruction, call printState to display the state change,
if any, from the instruction execution.
</OL>


<P>Below is a snippet of code from my main function.  You don't have
to follow this model, but you're welcome to.

<PRE> 

	SecurityLevel low  = SecurityLevel.LOW;
	SecurityLevel high = SecurityLevel.HIGH;

	// We add two subjects, one high and one low.

	sys.createSubject("Lyle", low);
	sys.createSubject("Hal", high);

	// We add two objects, one high and one low.

	sys.getReferenceMonitor().createNewObject("Lobj", low);
	sys.getReferenceMonitor().createNewObject("Hobj", high);

	...


</PRE>



<P> Scrutinize the output of your system execution and convince
yourself that you are actually following the BLP rules.  How do you
handle instructions that are not well-formed?  How do you handle
instructions that are not permissible according to the security
policy?  Make sure that your treatment of instructions is "robust" in
that you catch as many errors as possible.  For example, does the
subject exist?  Does the object exist?  

<P> While designing your system consider the following questions: <I>Are
there security flaws in this design?  What are they?  How might you go
about fixing them?</I>

<P>As an example of the execution, given the instruction list from Part 1 of this
assignment, my implementation gives the following output.  (Note that
none of this output should necessarily be visible to Hal and Lyle.)<BR>

<H2>Extra Credit </H2>

You can get up to 2 points extra credit on this assignment.  Since
it's extra credit, I'm not going to give you detailed instructions on
this part. If you want to do this one, you will have to use some
ingenuity, though I'm happy to help you individually. <P>

The assignment above is unrealistic in that the actions of subjects
Lyle and Hal are synchronized according to the ordering of
instructions in the input.  Reimplement this assignment so that Lyle
and Hal run as separate processes (threads), each reads from its own
instruction file (remove the subject name argument to each
instruction), and they share the reference monitor.  <P>

If you do this in the most straightforward way, they will run in an
arbitrarily interleaved fashion depending on the OS scheduling.  If
the instruction lists are short, whichever one gets the processor
first likely will just blow through his instruction list, finishing
before the other thread ever runs.  Add an additional SLEEP instruction
that relinguishes the processor.  I.e., if Hal is running and executes
a SLEEP instruction, then the processor should be handed to Lyle, etc.
That way you can force interesting interleavings.   Note that this may
not work as expected on multi-processor systems where the threads are
scheduled on separate processors.  Also, printing of the output may be
oddly interleaved.<P>

If you're having problems with the threads programming, these may
help.  Here is an excellent description of Java Synchronization by Ron
Rockhold: <A HREF="JavaSynchronization.pdf">Java Synchronization</A>,
and a link to helpful short paper by Prof. Mike Dahlin: <A
HREF="programming-with-threads.pdf"> Threads Programming</A>.
