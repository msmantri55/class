1. What is the T(N) of the following method?
2. What is the Big O of the following method?

public double total(double[] list)
{	double tot = 0;
	for(int i = 0; i < list.length; i++)
	{	tot += list[i];
	}
	return total;
}

3. What is the T(N) of the following code segment? 
4. What is the Big O of the following code segment? 

for(int i = 0; i < N; i++)
   for(int j = 0; j < N; j++)
      for(int k = 1; k < N; k *=2)
        method1(); //method1 is O(1)



5. What is the Big O of the following method?

Assume the ArrayList consturctor, the Math.sqrt, and the ArrayList add method
are all O(1).

/*
 * pre: limit >= 2
 */
public static ArrayList<Integer> findPrimes(int limit)
{   boolean numIsPrime = true;
	int numToDivideBy = 2;
	ArrayList<Integer> primes = new ArrayList<Integer>();
	// ArrayList default constructor is O(1)

	// go through all numbers
	for(int num = 2; num < limit; num++)
	{   numIsPrime = true;
		numToDivideBy = 2;

		double maxDivisor = Math.sqrt(num);
		while( numToDivideBy <= maxDivisor )
		{   assert numToDivideBy != 0 : numToDivideBy;
			numIsPrime = ( num % numToDivideBy ) != 0;
			numToDivideBy++;
		}

		if( numIsPrime )
			primes.add(num); //ArrayList add is O(1)
	}

	return primes
}

6. Do you think the Big O of the given findPrimes method can be improved? If
so, how?

7. A program is O(N). It takes the program 8 seconds to complete when working
with a data set of 100,000 items. (N = 100,000) What is the predicted time for
the program to complete when working with a data set of 200,000 items?

8. A program is O(N). It takes the program 12 seconds to complete when working
with a data set of 1,000,000 items. What is the predicted time for the program
to complete when working with a data set of 5,000,000 items?

9. A program is O(N^2). It takes the program 5 seconds to complete when working
with a data set of 10,000 items. (N = 10,000) What is the predicted time for the
program to complete when working with a data set of 20,000 items?

10. A program is O(N^2). It takes the program  1 minute to complete when working
with a data set of 100,000 items. (N = 100,000) What is the predicted time for
the program to complete when working with a data set of 500,000 items?

11. A program is O(N^2). It takes the program 40 seconds to complete when
working with a data set of 500,000 items. (N = 500,000) What is the predicted
time for the program to complete when working with a data set of 25,000 items?

12. A program is O(N^3). It takes the program 5 minutes to complete when working
with a data set of 1,000,000 items. What is the predicted time for the program
to complete when working with a data set of 3,000,000 items?

13. A program is O(NlogN) (the log is base 2). It takes the program 10 seconds
to complete when working with a data set of 1,000,000 items. What is the
predicted time for the program to complete when working with a data set of
8,000,000 items? log (base 2) of 1,000,000 ~= 20.
